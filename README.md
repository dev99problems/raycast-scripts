## Raycast
[raycastapp](https://www.raycast.com/) is a kind of tool, that can be described as `Spotlight` on steroids. 
It is **simple**, **flexible**, does not require any ~~paid subscription~~ at the moment, and provides a great functionality
of interacting with a lot of apps on your MacOS, not opening them at all.

Another killer feature â€” the ability to run scripts on `at the tips of fingers`.
So `this repo` is a home for my personal `scripts`, which I use pretty often. Nothing major, no rocket science,
just the small simple things, which make my life easier.
