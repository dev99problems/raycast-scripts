Home of **dev99problems'** `Raycast` daily routine scripts

## Raycast
[raycastapp](https://www.raycast.com/) is a kind of tool, that can be described as `Spotlight` on steroids. 
It is **simple**, **flexible**, does not require any **~~paid subscription~~** at the moment, and provides a great functionality
of interacting with a lot of apps on your MacOS, not opening directly.

Another **killer feature** ‚Äî the ability to run scripts at `the fingertips `.
So `this repo` is a home for my personal `scripts`, which I use pretty often. Nothing major, no rocket science,
just the small simple things, which `make my life easier`.

## List of commands

### üìπ video:convert

Scales down all `today` created videos (screencasts), using `ffmpeg` into 1920:1024 format.
Usually such scale down helps to lost up to **75% of the initial file size** and after that ‚Äî such files
are super easy and fast to share.

### üí≤ subsminder

Displays current active `monthly` subscriptions I have (stored at `Airtable`)
in a form table view with a `monthly total`.

### üõ´ synclair:(up & down)

Simply configured `rsync` command to sync local folder, full of `*.md` notes to iCloud.

### ü§ñ pulls:open

Gets all open `Github pull-requests` of author, from a `list of projects`, grouped by the `section`.

#### Rationale
Even though, `Raycast` has this functionality `out of the box`, if you use your `personal` Github account for both **personal**
projects and **private** projects of your work `organization`, you often need to request the broader list of `access` in your 
organization for this integration to be able to get your `work pull-requests` and it may be a problem.

**`So to avoid those`** restrictions and additional access requests, this little fellow was implemented.

Trims the meta data from [Great Suspender](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/the-great-suspender/jaekigmcljkkalnicnjoafgfjoefkpeg?hl=en) links.
