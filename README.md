## Raycast
[raycastapp](https://www.raycast.com/)  is ~~Spotlight on steroids~~ is a blazingly fast, extendable MacOS app launcher and way more!

Most of these **raycast scripts** are used on daily basis. Nothing major, 
just small simple things, which **make my life easier**.

## List of commands

### üìπ video:convert

Scales down all `today` created videos (screencasts), using `ffmpeg` into 1920:1024 format.
Usually such scale down helps to lost up to **75% of the initial file size** and after that ‚Äî such files
are super easy and fast to share.

### üí≤ subsminder

Displays current active `monthly/yearly` subscriptions I have (stored at `Airtable`)
in a form of a table view with `total` field, info about `paid` subs this month/year,
`next` closest payment and auto cron updater of payment dates while `subs` remain marked as `renewed`.
The same `cron` job sends messages one day before the next `monthly` subscription payment.

**Yearly subs**

### üõ´ synclair:(up & down)

Simply configured `rsync` command to sync local folder, full of `*.md` notes to iCloud.

### ü§ñ pulls:open

Gets all open `Github pull-requests` of author, from a `list of projects`, grouped by the `section`.

#### Rationale
Even though, `Raycast` has this functionality `out of the box`, if you use your `personal` Github account for both **personal**
projects and **private** projects of your work `organization`, you often need to request the broader list of `access` in your 
organization for this integration to be able to get your `work pull-requests` and it may be a problem.

**`So to avoid these`** restrictions and additional access requests, this little fellow was implemented.

### ‚úÇÔ∏è trim:link

Trims the meta data from [Great Suspender](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/the-great-suspender/jaekigmcljkkalnicnjoafgfjoefkpeg?hl=en) links.
Works pretty much the same as [great-suspender-link-trimmer](https://github.com/dev99problems/great-suspender-link-trimmer)
