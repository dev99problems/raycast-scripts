# TODO list for converter

## TODO 🛠️:
### Phase 0:

[X] Add: check and `automatic` folders creation
[X] Add: skip files that are already in `output` folder
[X] Try: how this works as `raycast-script` 
[ ] Check: if that is possible to add `raycast` notification when all files are converted
[ ] Think: whether you need to get the results of `compression`
[ ] The results of compression can be done as a text file in `output` dir

---------------------------------------------------------------


## Ideas 💡:
[ ] Idea: not sure this is really needed, but maybe I should consider add aditional script to 
 put files in different folders per `day`, it would be really cool to have some big folder with a lot
 of nested `day` folders inside
