## TODO

`[X]` add check and `automatic` folders creation
`[X]` add skipping conversion files that are already in `output/`
`[X]` implement `raycast` script version
`[ ]` add similair `dev/prod` flow as you have for `subsminder`
`[ ]` rewrite in `oop`-style
`[ ]` play around with `Ractor` or `IO.popen` to get the compression results/progress


## Open Questions
`[ ]` Q? is that possible to add `raycast` notification when all files are converted (OR any other system notif.)
`[ ]` Q? whether you need to get the results of `compression`
      The results of compression can be done as a separate .txt in `output` dir

## Ideas ðŸ’¡:
[ ] Not sure this is really needed, but maybe I should consider add aditional script to 
 put files into separate folders per `day`, it might be useful to a folder with a lot
 of nested `day` folders inside
